			<h2>Dallas Fuel suspends xQc for the rest of Overwatch League's first stage</h2>

			<p>Right now, one of the requirements to be a good Dota 2 player is that you've got to be a living, breathing human. The game does include some basic computer-controlled bots to practice against, but any seasoned player of the game should have no trouble prevailing over these bots, even on their hardest "Unfair" difficulty (though the Unfair Viper bot is a legendary jerk that's utterly miserable to play against).

The OpenAI bot took on a number of professional players and it crushed them.<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/08/ai-bot-takes-on-the-pros-at-dota-2-and-wins/">More ...</a></p>
