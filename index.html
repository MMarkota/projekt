		<p>A number of games are popular among professional competitors. The tournaments which emerged in the mid-1990s coincided with the popularity of fighting games and first-person shooters, genres which still maintain a devoted fan base.</p>
		<p>In the 2000s, real-time strategy games became overwhelmingly popular in South Korean internet cafes, with crucial influence on the development of eSports worldwide. After 2010 with the release of the Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne mod Defense of the Ancients, multiplayer online battle arena games became popular as eSports. </p>
		<p>Competitions exist for many titles and genres, though currently the most popular games are Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, Call of Duty, League of Legends, Dota 2, Smite, Rocket League, World of Tanks, Heroes of the Storm, Hearthstone, Super Smash Bros. Melee, StarCraft II and Overwatch.</p>
		<p>For well established games, total prize money can amount to millions of U.S. dollars a year. As of 10 September 2016, Dota 2 has awarded approximately US$86 million in prize money within 632 registered tournaments, with 23 players winning over $1 million.</p>
		<p>League of Legends awarded approximately $30 million within 1749 registered tournaments, but in addition to the prize money, Riot Games provides salaries for players within their League of Legends Championship Series.</p>
		<p>In August 2017, The International 2017, Valve's premier Dota 2 tournament, was held and broke records by having the largest prize pool to date for an eSports tournament, amounting to over US$24 million.</p>
